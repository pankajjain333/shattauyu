                        meticulous heating, cooling, grinding, paste making and differential cooking mechanisms and a

                                scientifically proven detoxification and regeneration therapy of the organism on the
                                cellular level. Panchakarma eliminates the deeply deposited waste materials from the
                                system, restores the normal function of the digestive organs, and deacidfies the
                                tissues, thus reestablishing the acid-base equilibrium. After the system is purified
                                from waste materials, roughage and “uninvited guests”, the foundational disease can be
                                treated more effectively and rapidly. This is made possible by the re-arrangement of the
                                self-regulatory and restitute mechanisms originally genetically coded into the human
                                body. And we support these processes by herbal medication (mostly of natural origin) and
                                various other procedures like massage, manual therapy (chiropractice) with mineral oils,
                                resins and breathing exercises, yoga, etc. The nervous system is most difficult to treat
                                and to regenerate, especially the vegetataive nervous system, as well as the peripheral
                                neurons. Therefore it appears that even after the thorough detoxification of the body,

                                completely. So,after the completion of the treatment therapy, a reiterative examination
                                and a complex invigorating and rejuvenation therapy called Rasayana is applied. Our
                                scientific views regarding the reasons for the development of diseases and the practical
                                approach to their trearment are apparently different from the presently accepted

                                is a two step process called purvakarma which involve : <br> Snehana: intake of
                                medicated herbal oils for 3 to 7 days depending upon the body constitution and ailment
                                of the person along with massage with medicated herbal oils to assist the softening and
                                mobilisation of toxins.<br>Svedana: fomentation therapy which siimulates the elimination
                                of toxins through the pores of the skin.Further it brings the toxins to the central part
                                to be eliminated through the nearest route.<br>This is followed by the purificatory and
                                detoxification therapy called panchkarma, which is applied with the purpose of complete
                                detoxification of the body, and purification of both body and mind .<br><br>
                                <b>Panchkarma</b> consists of following therapies: <br><b>VAMANA</b>- medicated induced
                                vomiting for alleviating Kapha disorders. <br><b>VIRECHANA</b>- Therapeutic purgation of
                                the bowels for Pitta disorders.<br> <b>NASYA</b> - for treating the disease of head and
                                neck. <br><b>BASTI</b> - Medicated enemas and for Vata disorders oil enemas. These
                                purificatory producers are designated to eliminate the accumulated toxins and other
                                waste materials out of the body. The elimination of toxins always result in relief and
                                revitalization of the system. The purificatory processes of the Panchakarma restore the
                                balance of the Doshas, causing a healing and preventing effect.
