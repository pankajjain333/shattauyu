                <p class="text-justify">The Panchakarma purification therapy is the most effective, scientifically proven detoxification and regeneration therapy of the organism on the cellular level. Panchakarma eliminates the deeply deposited waste materials from the system, restores the normal function of the digestive organs, and deacidfies the tissues, thus reestablishing the acid-base equilibrium. After the system is purified from waste materials, roughage and “uninvited guests”, the foundational disease can be treated more effectively and rapidly. This is made possible by the re-arrangement of the self-regulatory and restitute mechanisms originally genetically coded into the human body. And we support these processes by herbal medication (mostly of natural origin) and various other procedures like massage, manual therapy (chiropractice) with mineral oils, resins and breathing exercises, yoga, etc. The nervous system is most difficult to treat and to regenerate, especially the vegetataive nervous system, as well as the peripheral neurons.

                 during the treatment of certain disease like osteochondrosis, herniated disc, joint inflammations,abrasion of joint cartilage, neuralgia, 
             amenorrhea, disorders of libido and sexual virility, the symptoms donot dissapear completely. So,after the completion of the treatment therapy, a reiterative examination and a complex invigorating and rejuvenation therapy called Rasayana is applied. Our scientific views regarding the reasons for the development of diseases and the practical approach to their trearment are apparently different from the presently accepted views.<br> Before panchkarma ,we prepare the body for detoxification and cleaning.That is a two step process called purvakarma which involve : <br> Snehana: intake of medicated herbal oils for 3 to 7 days depending upon the body constitution and ailment of the person along with massage with medicated herbal oils to assist the softening and mobilisation of toxins.<br>Svedana: fomentation therapy which siimulates the elimination of toxins through the pores of the skin.Further it brings the toxins to the central part to be eliminated through the nearest route.<br>This is followed by the purificatory and detoxification therapy called panchkarma, which is applied with the purpose of complete detoxification of the body, and purification of both body and mind .<br> <b>Panchkarma</b> consists of following therapies: <br><b>VAMANA</b>- medicated induced vomiting for alleviating Kapha disorders. <br><b>VIRECHANA</b>- Therapeutic purgation of the bowels for Pitta disorders.<br> <b>NASYA</b> - for treating the disease of head and neck. <br><b>BASTI</b> - Medicated enemas and for Vata disorders oil enemas. These purificatory producers are designated to eliminate the accumulated toxins and other waste materials out of the body. The elimination of toxins always result in relief and revitalization of the system. The purificatory processes of the Panchakarma restore the balance of the Doshas, causing a healing and preventing effect.</p>
