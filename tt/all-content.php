				<p class="pt-4"><strong><u>Development of Diseases</u></strong> During scientific analysis of most of the diseases mentioned above, the same schemes can be observed in the chain of development of the disease, as follows:</p>


				<p>First of all , there is disturbance in the process of digestion and excretion (elimination of excreta or by-products of the body's vital functions), which results in imbalance of the acid-basic system in the body with the increase of acidity. This is inevitably followed by the increased activity of the latent viruses, bacteria and fungi, damage of the microflora of the tissues, and immune reaction in the form of inflammations, allergies and toxicosis. This is usually accompanied by deposition of a number of toxic metabolites deep into the various tissues of the body resulting into metabolic syndrome characterized by :</p>

				<p>Increse of the lipids (cholestrol, triglycerides), uric acid and blood glucose levels, resulting in inevitable deposits of them in the tissues and blood vessels, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, heart and liver disorders</p>

				<p>As a result, partial anoxia, acidity and activation of infections in the chondroid and bone tissues happens.The endocrine glands are damaged, which result in hormone disorders like thyroid etc. Others is the development of diseases in the locomotive system, urinary tract and the female reproductive organs. The human body, which may be stuck in this toxic condition for years, will inevitably exhaust the resources of the nervous hormones (neurons, enzymes), which results in: insomnia, anxiety, depression, panic states and chronic headaches.
				</p>
				<p>Hence, the actual treatment of any disease involves the diagnaosis and treatment of each pathologic chain-link, simultaneously observing the holistic and individual approach.</p>



				<p class="pt-4"><strong><u>DIAGNOSIS</u></strong> According to teaching of Ayurveda the patient is a living book which the physian should be able to read. The symptom of disease always manifest with the loss of system's equilibrium.Ayurveda gives very accurate method for the identification of the disease process even before the manifestation of any visible symptoms of it.</p>

				<p>The physician identifies the information regarding the disease from the bodily signs like the pulse ,tongue , face, nails, eyes, skin, limbs, posture and abdomen. With the help of these he can identify the pathological processes taking place in the body, the weakened organs, and the sites of accumulation of toxins.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately the modern laboratory technology has pushed the diagnotic abilities of the physicians to the background. Laboratory tests give good footing to the dia gnostics ,but natural diagnostics is indispensible as it gives a considerably more complete picture of the mental and bodily state of the patient along with its current changes.</p>



				<p class="pt-4"><strong><u>TREATMENT</u></strong> Considering the high sensitivity of the digestive system, the liver and the kidneys towards the synthetic (allopathic) medicines, as well as the number of their side-effects, the application of Ayurvedic Panchakarma Treatment and preparations, time-tested and verified for thousands of years is favoured in the first phase. The Panchakarma purification therapy is the most effective, scientifically proven detoxification and regeneration therapy of the organism on the cellular level. Panchakarma eliminates the deeply deposited waste materials from the system, restores the normal function of the digestive organs, and deacidfies the tissues, thus reestablishing the acid-base equilibrium.</p>

				<p>After the system is purified from waste materials, roughage and uninvited guests, the foundational disease can be treated more effectively and rapidly. This is made possible by the re-arrangement of the self-regulatory and restitute mechanisms originally genetically coded into the human body. And we support these processes by herbal medication (mostly of natural origin) and various other procedures like massage, manual therapy (chiropractice) with mineral oils, resins and breathing exercises, yoga, etc.</p>

				<p>The nervous system is most difficult to treat and to regenerate, especially the vegetataive nervous system, as well as the peripheral neurons. Therefore it appears that even after the thorough detoxification of the body, during the treatment of certain disease like osteochondrosis, herniated disc, joint inflammations,abrasion of joint cartilage, vegetataive distony, neuralgia, amenorrhea, disorders of libido and sexual virility, the symptoms donot dissapear completely. So,after the completion of the treatment therapy, a reiterative examination and a complex invigorating and rejuvenation therapy called Rasayana is applied.</p>

				<p>Our scientific views regarding the reasons for the development of diseases and the practical approach to their trearment are apparently different from the presently accepted views.</p>

				<h4>1. Metabolic disorder correction/treatment:</h4>
				<p>Due to faulty dietary habits and unbalanced activity regime, the main digestive gland i.e. Liver functioning is imbalanced. Todays popular fast foods like burgers, pizzas with a combination of aerated soft drinks and alcohol hampers the functioning of GIT in such a way that the whole body Ph changes and acid-base imbalance starts in the body. It can be explained as - with such kinds of food mentioned above, actually what happens is that they are not digested in same time as the normal food as they are made up of fine flours and the digestion is sluggish. Result is long time lasting of food in the intestine and its fermentation leading to the formation of acid and gas. Aerated soft drinks have plenty of CO2 and this further adds to the gas formation especially in the large intestine. Colon is full with gases and distended and small intestines have atonia and undigested food along with gases causes flatulencia and tenderness of the abdomen. Toxic acid is also absorbed in the blood and this circulating toxic acid causes various kinds of skin diseases and arthritis, as the body Ph changes.</p>
				<br>
				<strong>What happens?</strong>
				<p>The stomach, which is normally lying in a slightly slanting downward position, now, due to the distention of colon lies flat on the stomach bed and thereby preventing the normal and timely flow of contents of stomach into the intestines. Due to this position of the stomach a person feels heavines or vomiting sensation at certain times immediately after eating as the food is not able to go into the intestines due to the changed position of the stomach. Secondly, the problem of acidity begins here or acid reflux due to the regurgitation of gastric contents into the oesophagus.</p>
				<br>
				<strong>Subsequent problem:</strong>
				<p>In this condition, the patient goes to the doctor and they choose to give antacids, which further lowers the acid content of the stomach thereby reducing the rate of digestion, as there is not enough acid to digest the food. According to ayurveda agni goes down and then even normal food items are not digested well leading to more and more gases and toxins in the abdomen.</p>
				<br>
				<strong>Solution:</strong>
				<p>is Panchkarma to take out the undigested matter and preventing fermentation thereby cleaning the gases out to bring colon and stomach to its normal position to counteract the acidity problem also. Not only is GIT balanced, acid base imbalance in the entire body is maintained</p>

				<strong>Why use Panchkarma/Detoxification therapy?<br>
					OR<br>
					Importance of Panchkarma/Detoxification therapy?
				</strong>
				<p>Ayurveda, the Indian science of medicine, has its main wing under Kaya chikitsa where Kaya stands for Agni. Treatment of this element (AGNI) among the panch-mahabhoot is therefore the solution / answer to most problems associated with the human body. Ayurveda explains the reason for using this approach for the treatment as every disease is said to have originated from the disturbance in the Agni i.e. it said to be the root cause of almost all diseases.</p>
				<br>

				<strong>What is Agni?</strong>
				<p>Agni is the fire element from the panch-mahabhoots, which is responsible for the digestion of the food stuffs or whatever we eat and therefore ultimately for the health and nutrition of the human body. Where is Agni located in the human body? Although it is present in each and every cell of the human body, the main seat of the principal agni(weblink) is the Grahni or duodenum i.e. the first part of the small intestine. Digestive secretion from the liver and pancreas, the principal glands helping in digestion, also enter into the small intestine from this part known as Grahni.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-12 mt-5">
				<h4>3.Liver Problems :</h4>
				<p>Person taking faulty diet (fast foods, high fat, low fibre) mentioned above along with alcohol, put an extra load on the liver. Liver cells get exhausted to digest such food secreting more and more bile. At a stage these foods are not digested properly and cholestrol and triglycerides are raised so much in the blood. Fats are also deposited on the Liver further deteriorating the function of Liver. As mentioned in GIT Problems, distended colon also sometimes put an upward pressure over the bile duct thereby preventing its secretion in the intestines, leading to the stasis of secretion of liver, filling the liver canaliculi (small passages) with litres of crude toxic bile, which is then absorbed in the blood causing Jaundice and other related liver problems.</p>
				<br>
				<strong>What is the solution to this problem?</strong>
				<p><strong>Panchkarma</strong> What we do in the first procedure in Vamana, we take out this crude toxic bile in the liver which is deposited there from years. Once the load on the liver is removed, Agni in the Liver is kindled to digest all kinds of bad cholesterol and triglycerides and deposited fat on it. Within 15 days to 1 month blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels along with the liver enzymes comes to normal.</p>
				<p>Secondly, Liver according to ayurveda is a mesh or filter between the food and our body. Our body uses the food what we eat after passing through the liver as it metabolizes the various things in the food. If our liver is loaded with heavy toxins, fats, and lot of bile, our mesh or filter itself is blocked and whatever healthy or balanced diet we eat is not able to reach the body tissues. You can imagine the example of a dirty, blocked drain to understand it. If we put clean water over a blocked drain, it will not allow it to pass through it. Similarly, when our liver is blocked and loaded with extra material (food nutritions) whatever we put into it will not be able to go through it into the body.</p>
				<br>
				<strong>What is the alternative for this?</strong>
				<p>Clean the mesh or filter i.e. the LIVER by panchkarma.</p>

				<h4>4. Anxiety and Stress disorders management:</h4>
				<p>In todays stressful life every second person is suffering from anxiety and stress.</p>
				<br>
				<strong>What is the reason, do you know?</strong>
				<p>Let us see -><br>
				We all have a biological clock fitted in our body: Are we ever conscious about it? We are never aware of it. We actually have no time to adjust our routine or schedule to go according to time. This indiscipline causes disharmony in ones inner body system, which is, not actually ready every time to face the stimulus coming to it. Moreover after certain activity we are not giving any time to the body to take a pause or break.Now a days there is a new tradition also in our schedule that is late night working on the computer, net or watching late night TV. And Thus, here also we are not allowing the body system to take rest properly. So, we are over using the body system in a sense.</p>

				<p>To understand this, we must know that there are two systems in the body, namely, sympathetic and para sympathetic nervous system, which work opposite to each other. During the time of work or stress, our sympathetic system is active and therefore the heart rate, respiration rate and muscle activity increases whereas the digestive system functioning is slowed. On the contrary, at the time of rest or relaxation the para sympathetic system is active and heart rate, respiration rate etc. are lowered and digestive system functioning is enhanced.</p>

				<p>Therefore, we need observing and balancing the two systems every time. As the para sympathetic nervous system serves as a base for body for growth, repair and healing. If we are over working, sympathetic system is hyper active and excess of stress hormones are flowing always in the blood and we are not able to relax even at the time of rest.</p>

				<p>Result is vague symptoms in the body like feeling of vibrations or tingling sensation in the limbs, palpitations (awareness of heart beat), insomnia, headaches etc. due to the disturbance in the nerve conduction. Such persons with exhausted sympathetic system then have deficiency of these hormones in their stores and then they are not able to perform before the world at par when needed.</p>
				<br>
				<strong>What is the solution?</strong>
				<p><strong>PanchkarmaThrough</strong> which we make an attempt to calm down the touch receptors in the skin or the nerve endings through different procedures. Sirodhara and different kind of bastis (herbal enemas) are helpful in maintaining the harmony between the two systems. Yoga, pranayama, and meditation along with the rejuvenation therapy play a beneficial role in altering the activity of the nervous system back.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-12 mt-5">
				<h4>5. Urological disorders treatment:</h4>
				<p>Body throws its wastes out through stool, urine and sweat. Problem of passing urine again and again, burning sensation while passing urine, kidney stones etc. are very common.</p>

				<strong>Why they happen?</strong>
				<p>The reason here again lies in the digestive system as we have discussed before. That is, when the stool is not regular, there are gases in the abdomen and there is a continuous pressure over the urinary bladder. Moreover, gases in the abdomen also cause constipation and the body has a tendency to get rid of toxins through urine. Therefore, frequency to pass the urine increases or there is a continuous urge to pass the urine.</p>
				<p>Now, let us see, what is the reason of Kidney stones according to ayurveda. Gases in the colon put pressure over ureters also and there is a back pressure and stasis of material in the kidneys, resulting in the formation of kidney stones.</p>
				<strong>What is the Solution?</strong>
				<p>Panchkarma, to remove the pressure or abdominal strain by cleaning the intestines and micro channels, so that, there is no undue pressure over the excretory organs and the vata(air element) can flow into its natural path, that is, through the lower body openings. There by facilitating the elimination of the excreta through their natural routes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-12 my-5">
				<h4>6.Arthritis</h4>
				<p>Problem of arthritis is very common. Especiallv, arthritis of knee, rheumatoid arthritis,arthritis due to increased uric acid levels etc.People take antiinflammatory analgesic years after years but ultimately no relief and further joint replacement therapy and so on. Moreover, the use of pain killers for long time disturbes the digesti ve system causing the problems like acidity ,gas etc.</p>
				<br>
				<strong>What to do? </strong>
				<p>If we go through the reason of joint problems according to ayurveda, we find the same reason as stated earlier in other diseases that the AMA or undigested matter in the intestines dur to the weak agni is absorbed in the body system and find a comfortable place in the narrow passages in the small joints first and later in the big joints and get settled there causing inflammmation and degeneration. So, to clean these narrow passages and to dislodge the toxins from there is the only solution and that is possible only through PANCHKARMA.
				So, now we can easily understand the very basis of most of the diseases in ayurveda lies in the deep seated toxins in the tissues which can be taken out from the body only through Panchkarma or Detoxification programme.</p>
